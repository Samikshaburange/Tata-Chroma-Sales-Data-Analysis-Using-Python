Tata Chroma Sales Data Analysis Using Python
## About

The goal of this project is to analysis the sales budget data, extract necessary information about Products and Customers based on a combination of features and make a dashboard to review the performance of the company.

## About Data

Dataset is created by using python random library.


### Analysis List

1. Product Analysis

> Conduct analysis on the data to understand the different product lines, the products lines performing best and the product lines that need to be improved.

2. Sales Analysis

> This analysis aims to answer the question of the sales trends of product. The result of this can help use measure the effectiveness of each sales strategy the business applies and what modificatoins are needed to gain more sales.

3. Customer Analysis

> This analysis aims to uncover the different customers segments, purchase trends and the profitability of each customer segment.

## Approach Used

1. Collect Raw Data, Data Wrangling

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Exploratory data analysis is done to answer the listed questions and aims of this project.

We start by cleaning our data. Tasks during this section include:

Drop NaN values from DataFrame
Removing rows based on a condition
Change the type of columns (to_numeric, to_datetime, astype)
Once we have cleaned up our data a bit, we move the data exploration section. In this section we explore 5 high level business questions related to our data:

## Business Questions To Answer

1. What was the best month for sales? How much was earned that month?
2. What city sold the most product?
3. What time should we display advertisemens to maximize the likelihood of customerâ€™s buying product?
4. What products are most often sold together?
5. What product sold the most? Why do you think it sold the most?

## we walk through many different pandas & matplotlib methods. They include 

1. Concatenating multiple csvs together to create a new DataFrame (pd.concat)
2. Adding columns
3. Parsing cells as strings to make new columns (.str)
4. Using the .apply() method
5. Using groupby to perform aggregate analysis
6. Plotting bar charts and lines graphs to visualize our results
7. Labeling our graphs
